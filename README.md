# Raspberry Pi Handbook
***

This repository is mainly intented to minimalisticaly track the steps for installing Ubuntu on a Raspberry Pi 4 with overclocking the CPU and software fine tuning, until it becomes the desired coding machine we aspire for.

                                      
I strongly advise to also check the Wiki pages. .||.
